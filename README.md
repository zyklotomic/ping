# Cloudflare Internship Application: Systems
### About
This is my submission for the "Cloudflare Internship Application: Systems"
application. It is written in Rust and directly interfaces with
the Linux syscalls `socket()`, `sendto()`, `recv()`, etc. For reference,
as of time of writing, `uname` reports `5.2.21 #1-NixOS SMP x86_64 GNU/Linux`.

Repository location github.com/zyklotomic/ping
## Building it
```
cargo build
```
The resulting binary will be located at`./target/debug/ping`.

## Running it
```
ping 1.0.0
Ethan Tsz Hang Kiang @zyklotomic
A cute little `ping` in Rust

USAGE:
    ping [OPTIONS] <dest>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -c, --count <count>          Stop sending after <count> many packets have been sent.
    -i, --interval <interval>    Wait <interval> seconds between sending each packet. Default is one second.
    -t <ttl>                     ttl

ARGS:
    <dest>    Target destination. Only Ipv4 supported
```
### Notes
Relevant permissions need to be set to run `ping`.

Update `sysctl` paramater `net.ipv4.ping_group_range` to include your group id (`id -g`).

```
$ id -g
1000
$ sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ping_group_range="0 1000"
net.ipv4.ping_group_range = 0 2000
```
To run without root, enable 'setuid' bit.
```
$ sudo chown root:root ./target/debug/ping
$ sudo chmod u+s ./target/debug/ping
$ sudo chmod g+s ./target/debug/ping
```

Thank you to Amit for that very helpful article with which I wouldn't have been able to write this without.

## What is it?

Please write a small Ping CLI application for MacOS or Linux.
The CLI app should accept a hostname or an IP address as its argument, then send ICMP "echo requests" in a loop to the target while receiving "echo reply" messages.
It should report loss and RTT times for each sent message.

Please choose from among these languages: C/C++/Go/Rust

## Requirements

### 1. Use one of the specified languages

Please choose from among C/C++/Go/Rust. If you aren't familiar with these languages, you're not alone! Many engineers join Cloudflare without
specific langauge experience. Please consult [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) or [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html).

### 2. Build a tool with a CLI interface

The tool should accept as a positional terminal argument a hostname or IP address.

### 3. Send ICMP "echo requests" in an infinite loop

As long as the program is running it should continue to emit requests with a periodic delay.

### 4. Report loss and RTT times for each message

Packet loss and latency should be reported as each message received.

## Submitting your project

When submitting your project, you should prepare your code for upload to Greenhouse. The preferred method for doing this is to create a "ZIP archive" of your project folder: for more instructions on how to do this on Windows and Mac, see [this guide](https://www.sweetwater.com/sweetcare/articles/how-to-zip-and-unzip-files/).

Please provide the source code only, a compiled binary is not necessary.

## Using Libraries

You may use libraries (both built-in and installed via package managers) and system calls as necessary. Please don't use the ping built-in application or a full library implementation of ping.

## Extra Credit

1. Add support for both IPv4 and IPv6
2. Allow to set TTL as an argument and report the corresponding "time exceeded‚Äù ICMP messages
3. Any additional features listed in the ping man page or which you think would be valuable
